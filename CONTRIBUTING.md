# Contributing to Matching Engine

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Matching Engine. It's people like you that make Matching Engine such a great tool.

### Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/OPNX-live/matching-engine/issues/new)! We love hearing from you, and you're more likely to get your issue addressed if you make it clear and provide sufficient detail.

### Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork Matching Engine and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

\`\`\`bash
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-translations
\`\`\`

### Get the test suite running

Make sure you have the development environment running and that all tests pass before you start adding new code. This might involve setting up software on your development machine.

### Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/OPNX-live/matching-engine/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/OPNX-live/matching-engine/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Implemented a new feature or fixed a bug?
